This Patch removes thecheck for equality between the volume_type of the source
and the destination of the clone.  This check was added to prevent the attempt
to clone from one backend to the next, but now also limits the funcationality 
of cloning on a single backend. We have this patch to get rid of this check 
assuming you know what you are doing.  If you try to clone between 2 backends
something else will not be happy (fail) so be careful.

The plan is to submit a change to Kilo where we will fail this check only if 
a change of type would cause a clone across backends and then allow the clone
if the source and destination are the same array.
